Gameplay:
Your final grade is determined based on story, description, and gameplay mechanics. Please describe and discuss: The story is based on Norse mythology, and the events taking place just before the world ends, called the Ragnarok. To prevent this from happening, the player has to convince the mistletoe not to hurt one of the gods, Baldr, since his death starts the chain of events leading up to the Ragnarok. Much of the gameplay is similar to Lost Pig, in that the game is mainly driven by puzzles, which bring the player closer to completing a typically simple task. This uses a progression dynamic since success is measured by completing the tasks.

How well does the game accomplish what you set out to do?
The game is pretty similar to what I originally imagined. I added a couple of extra features that I didn't know about when first starting to create the game, and changed a few minor things (had a single books instead of a bookshelf in each room, since the naming would get complicated), but overall, the game story and puzzles themselves have stayed pretty much the same.

Discuss a time when you got stuck, and how you got unstuck.
I had a couple of issues when I wanted to have a menu based chat. I figured this would be better than having the player guess at what to say. The easiest way to do that would be to add an extension, so I tried using the Quip-Based Conversation Michael Martin. However, there were issues trying to get the extension to compile. I tried searching for a solution, and they said that there were some areas in the source text where "greeting" had to be changed to "greetings." However, after a couple of attempts I decided to just switch out the extension and use the Simple Chat by Mark Tilford.

Describe each of the required three puzzles in your game and how to solve each puzzle.
The first puzzle is a combining puzzle, so the player has to break the statue and examine Hel's Gate to get the metal barb and the staff. After combining the two objects, the player receives the fishing pole, which they use to get Gjallarhorn. The next puzzle is getting into Asgard, which requires a couple of steps. The player has to give Gjallarhorn to Heimdallr, which unlocks the large gate, allowing the player to access Valhalla and get the map from the centerpiece (which they have to open). The map allows them to go to the Forest Clearing, and then unlock Asgard's Gate. The last puzzle is watering the mistletoe with water from the fountain in Asgard. There are hints given to the player by the mistletoe and in the book they can get in the Portal Room.

Discuss the gameplay mechanics in your game and how they improve the user's experience.
Most of the game dynamics I used were victory dynamics, in that they controlled how the player wins the game. There isn't a social element, a fighting element, or even a point system. I wanted the main focus of the game to be figuring out the puzzles. The task is relatively simple, but to complete it the player has to complete a bunch of smaller tasks. There is only one way to die in my game, so player "safety" is secured.

Beta Testing:
Discuss the beta testing process: Who tested your game? 
My first beta tester was my sister. She tested my game when it was about 90% complete. My second beta tester was Devon Lee, who tested my game during class when I had finished my code. 

How did their feedback affect your game? 
My sister helped by suggesting different "understand" commands, since some of the puzzles used a very narrow vocabulary, making them extremely hard to solve. She also inputted several examine commands that I had to add descriptions to. Devon mainly helped with the puzzles. Some of the steps I had assumed the player would make weren't very obvious, so his actions helped me decide were I should add hints.

Whose game did you beta test? 
I tested Devon's game.




What feedback were you able to give?
Devon's game wasn't completely finished, so there were still some parts he had to code (NPCs were there, but you couldn't interact with them). The main thing that I noticed was that many of his rooms didn't have any directions, so it was difficult figuring out where to go. We also found and fixed a problem with his human cannon, since it wasn't letting the player jump backwards in time when it was necessary. 

Other:
What are you most proud of?
I'm most proud of the old book, since the player is able to read the pages in the book. Although I didn't write much of the code allowing the player to use numbers or words to read certain pages, I added extra pieces to it. I made it so certain pages had to be unlocked first, and added extra understand commands for reading the book. Since the player would have to input a page number, I changed the error messages so that it would prompt the player to change the input. It also took a while figuring out where I should put a couple lines of text to make the book unreadable if it was wet.

What would you do differently next time?
There isn’t much about the game that I would change; so much as I would like to keep adding on to it. I ended the game after the player waters the mistletoe, but I could've added more talk features so you had to talk to it again after giving it the fountain water. I could have even made it so that the player would be unable to convince it, and would have to keep playing to stop the end of the world a different way. I'm a little worried that I made the steps too obvious. While I did explicitly state some steps (to help the player along, especially on the combining puzzle) I'm hoping there is still an element to figuring it out. If I redid the game, I would probably take out a couple of the hints I left in.
