"Ragnarok" by Marissa Takebayashi

[commented sections of code are parts I did not write.]

Use no scoring.

Rule for deciding whether all includes something: it does not.

Instead of examining player, say "You are a human of average height and weight. You are a generally average person, not having done any astounding feats of bravery, or seen anything particularly extraordinary. Maybe your wish for adventure will soon be fulfilled."

When play begins: say "You wake up in a strange room, not entirely knowing why you are here, or even where you are. There isn't much in the room to suggest why you are here, maybe you can find something in this room to help you remember."

The Portal Room is a room. "A mostly empty room. The walls are all a bland grey and there are no windows. There is a bookshelf leaning against one of the walls. [paragraph break] To the south is the Underworld, Midgard it to the west, and there is a large gate to the north."

The statue is a thing in the Portal Room. The description is "A large stone statue of a tall bearded man holding a staff. It looks like part of the statue is starting to fall off. You can just make out hairline cracks near the hand holding the staff."

Understand "stone statue" or "hand" as statue.

The staff is in the Portal Room. "A long stone pole. It looks much heavier than it actually is."

Instead of examining staff:
	if player is not carrying staff, say "A long stone staff that the statue is holding.";
	if player is carrying staff, say "A long stone pole. It looks much heavier than it actually is."

Instead of attacking the statue: 
    	move staff to player; 
    	say "You reach up and break off the staff that the statue was holding. It is a lot heavier than you expected, but still manageable."

Instead of attacking the staff:
	move staff to player; 
    	say "You reach up and break off the staff that the statue was holding. It is a lot heavier than you expected, but still manageable."

Instead of taking the staff, say "you are going to need to use more force to do that."
	
Instead of taking the statue:
	say "That is way too large to carry."

The bookshelf is a thing in the Portal Room. The description is "A large wooden bookshelf. Mostly empty, except for an old dusty book on one of the rows."

Instead of taking the bookshelf:
	say "I don't think you can carry that."

Rule for writing a paragraph about the bookshelf:
	say " "

The old book is in the bookshelf. The old book has a number called the last page read. The old book has a number called the length. The length of the old book is 6."An ancient book that seems to be about the various myths and places in these worlds. There appears to be six pages in the book that are a mix of readable and unreadable characters."

Understand "ancient book" or "book" or "dusty book" or "dusty old book" as old book.

[Understand the command "read" as something new.

Understand "read [something]" or "consult [something]" or "read in/from [something]" as reading. Reading is an action applying to one thing.

Understand "read [number] in/from/of [something]" or "read page [number] in/from/of [something]" or "look up page [number] in/from/of [something]" or "consult page [number] in/from/of [something]" as reading it in. Reading it in is an action applying to one number and one thing.

Named page is a kind of value. The named pages are first page, last page, next page, previous page.
To decide what number is the effective value of (L - last page): 
    decide on the length of the book.
To decide what number is the effective value of (F - first page): 
    decide on 1.
To decide what number is the effective value of (N - next page): 
    let X be the last page read of the book plus 1; 
    decide on X.
To decide what number is the effective value of (P - previous page): 
    let X be the last page read of the book minus 1; 
    decide on X.

Understand "read [named page] in/from/of [something]" or "read the [named page] in/from/of [something]" as reading it relatively in. Reading it relatively in is an action applying to one named page and one thing.

Does the player mean reading something in the old book: it is very likely.

This is the book requirement rule: 
	if the player is not carrying the old book:
		say "You're not reading anything.";
		stop the action;]
	if the old book is wet, say "The book is too soaked to read, thanks to your carelessness." instead.

[Check reading it relatively in: 
    if the second noun is not the old book, say "There are no pages in [the second noun]." instead; 
    abide by the book requirement rule.

Carry out reading it relatively in: 
    let N be the effective value of the named page understood; 
    now the number understood is N; 
    try reading N in the book.

Check reading it in: 
    if the second noun is not the old book, say "There are no pages in [the second noun]." instead; 
    abide by the book requirement rule.

Check reading it in: 
    if the number understood is greater than the length of the old book, say "There are only [length of old book in words] pages in the book." instead; 
    if the number understood is less than 1, say "The page numbering begins with 1." instead.

Carry out reading it in: 
    read page number understood.

Check reading: 
    if the noun is not the old book, say "There are no pages in [the noun]." instead; 
    abide by the book requirement rule.]

Table of Book Contents
page	content
1	"[bold type] About the Ragnarok. [roman type] In Norse mythology, Ragnar√∂k is a series of events, including a great battle that will result in the death of a number of Gods. The Gods, understandably, don't want to die just yet, so they have appointed you to stop it. It is a great honor, they assure you, just don't fail. The Ragnarok officially begins when one of the Gods, Baldr, dies by being impaled with a spear covered in mistletoe, since it was the only living thing, in all of the nine realms, that hadn't been asked not to hurt Baldr. A minor oversight by Baldr's mother, who tried to prevent his death. In order to stop this from happening, you must convince the mistletoe not to harm Baldr."
2	"[bold type] About the Underworld. [roman type] The Underworld is Hel's domain. She doesn't appear to be there at the moment, but she left the gate open, allowing you to walk up to the river Gjoll. Heimdallr's horn, Gjallarhorn, comes from this river. However, the river Gjoll is said to feel like thousands of knives, so I wouldn't be to hasty to go swimming. Maybe if you had some sort of pole..."
3	"[bold type] About Midgard. [roman type] For the time being, the Gods have restricted the accessible area of your home world to a janitor's closet and a small forest just outside. They say it is incentive for you to work faster. Not everything here is trash, though, and you may even find something to help you on your journey."
4	"[bold type] About Valhalla. [roman type] Valhalla, where fallen heroes come to celebrate. Seeing as you aren't dead yet, and haven't done anything particularly heroic, Valhalla doesn't hold that much significance to you. Although I would look around closely, you never know what you might find."
5	"[bold type] About the Forest. [roman type] The forest, home to the infamous mistletoe. Although mistletoe may seem unimportant, it plays a large role in the upcoming events. To stop the Ragnarok, you must secure a vow from it, saying that it promises to not harm Baldr. However, this is easier said than done, since the mistletoe doesn't seem up to bargaining in its current mood."
6	"[bold type] About Asgard. [roman type] The home of the Gods. Or the ones that you care about, anyway. Everything here is extravagant and well-polished. Although you are not allowed into the actual city, the fountain near the entrance shows the lavishness of the Gods quite well. Pure, fine, Asgardian water flows from this fountain. It makes you thirsty just looking at it."
