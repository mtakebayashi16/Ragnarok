You wake up in a strange room, not entirely knowing why you are here, or even where you are. There isn&apos;t much in the room to suggest why you are here, maybe you can find something in this room to help you remember.

Ragnarok
An Interactive Fiction by Marissa Takebayashi
Release 1 / Serial number 140311 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Portal Room
A mostly empty room. The walls are all a bland grey and there are no windows. There is a bookshelf leaning against one of the walls. 

 To the south is the Underworld, Midgard it to the west, and there is a large gate to the north.

A long stone pole. It looks much heavier than it actually is.

 
You can also see a large gate, a statue and Heimdallr here.

The Gods, understandably, don&apos;t want to die just yet, so they have appointed you to stop it. It is a great honor, they assure you, just don&apos;t fail. The Ragnarok officially begins when one of the Gods, Baldr, dies by being impaled with a spear covered in mistletoe, since it was the only living thing, in all of the nine realms, that hadn&apos;t been asked not to hurt Baldr. A minor oversight by Baldr&apos;s mother, who tried to prevent his death. In order to stop this from happening, you must convince the mistletoe not to harm Baldr.&quot;

You can also see a large gate, a statue and Heimdallr here.

The Gods, understandably, don&apos;t want to die just yet, so they have appointed you to stop it. It is a great honor, they assure you, just don&apos;t fail. The Ragnarok officially begins when one of the Gods, Baldr, dies by being impaled with a spear covered in mistletoe. In order to stop this from happening, you must convince the mistletoe not to harm Baldr.&quot;
