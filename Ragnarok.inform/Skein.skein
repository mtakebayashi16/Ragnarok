You wake up in a strange room, not entirely knowing why you are here, or even where you are. There isn&apos;t much in the room to suggest why you are here, maybe you can find something in this room to help you remember.

You read: &quot; About the Ragnarok.  In Norse mythology, Ragnar√∂k is a series of events, including a great battle that will result in the death of a number of Gods. The Gods, understandably, don&apos;t want to die just yet, so they have appointed you to stop it. It is a great honor, they assure you, just don&apos;t fail. The Ragnarok officially begins when one of the Gods, Baldr, dies by being impaled with a spear covered in mistletoe. In order to stop this from happening, you must convince the mistletoe not to harm Baldr.&quot;
