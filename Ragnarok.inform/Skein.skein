You read: &quot; About the Ragnarok.  In Norse mythology, Ragnarök is a series of events, including a great battle that will result in the death of a number of Gods. The Gods, understandably, don&apos;t want to die just yet, so they have appointed you to stop it. It is a great honor, they assure you, just don&apos;t fail. The Ragnarok officially begins when one of the Gods, Baldr, dies by being impaled with a spear covered in mistletoe. In order to stop this from happening, you must convince the mistletoe not to harm Baldr.&quot;

The Gods, understandably, don&apos;t want to die just yet, so they have appointed you to stop it. It is a great honor, they assure you, just don&apos;t fail. The Ragnarok officially begins when one of the Gods, Baldr, dies by being impaled with a spear covered in mistletoe.

Forest Clearing
A small grassy patch in the middle of the forest. There are tall pine trees surrounding the area. Sunlight filters down into the clearing, but the rest of the forest is obscured. 

 To the north is Midgard.

A large ornate golden key. It looks like it would fit into a large ornate golden gate.

You can also see Mistletoe here.

You&apos;ll have to get out of the Forest Clearing first.
